Joe Schlick's week 5 homework

This project is a day planner application. It shows the current day at the top, and below it has a row for each buisiness hour of the day (9am to 5pm). The user can enter text in each row, and save it by clicking the save button. When the page is refreshed the saved text will reload.

The project consists of 3 files - index.html, (in Assets folder) style.css, and script.js.
